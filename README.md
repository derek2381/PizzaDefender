# PizzaDefender

Pizza Defender
In this exciting game project developed using Unity and C#, I created a playable character tasked with defending against a horde of charging animals by shooting piping hot pizzas at them.
Key Features:
Interactive Gameplay: Players control a character who can shoot pizzas at randomly spawning animals, destroying them instantly upon contact. The game tests players' reflexes and targeting skills as they fend off the relentless onslaught of hungry creatures.
Random Enemy Spawning: Animals spawn at random positions on the scene, adding an element of unpredictability and keeping players on their toes. This dynamic element ensures that each gameplay session is unique and engaging.
Camera Movement: The camera seamlessly follows the player's movements, providing a smooth and immersive gaming experience as they navigate the environment.
Game Over and Restart: If an animal manages to reach the player, the game enters a "Game Over" state. Players have the option to restart the game immediately, allowing them to jump back into the action and try their luck again.
Through this project, I further developed my skills in Unity game engine, C# programming, game mechanics implementation, and user interface design. The project challenged me to integrate various gameplay elements, such as character control, collision detection, random spawning, camera movement, and game state management.
I am excited to have completed this project and look forward to continuing my journey in game development, exploring new techniques and ideas to create even more engaging and immersive gaming experiences.
Feel free to check out the project and provide any feedback or suggestions!
